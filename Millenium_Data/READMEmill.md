This contains the raw data for the dark matter particles and halos from the Millennium Simulation. Note Millenium_Data is missing an "n", but this is hard-coded so I left it. 

The original README is as follows:

The file mbp_positions_063_M13_matched.txt has the list of haloes from the Millennium simulation with their properties.

Relevant columns are:

7,8,9 : x, y, z Cartesian coordinates of halo centres, in the unit of Mpc/h.

12: halo mass / 10^10  [M_sun/h]

14: r_200 [Mpc/h]

The file ParticleData_Point1Percent.txt has the original particle data from the Millennium simulation.

It has been downsampled to reduce the number of particle. There are 6 columns for each file. 

1-3: x, y, z Cartesian coordinates, in the unit of Mpc/h

4-6: vx, vy, vz peculiar velocities in the unit of km/s
